  <h4>Winter sports to try</h4>
  <p><b>Snow Shoeing - </b> is the fasted growing winter sport in the world, primarily because it is simple to get to grips with, inexpensive (compared to other spow sports!), and is a great way to burn off all the vin chaud and tartiflette you just had! There are many levels of snowshoeing, whether you want to hike for pleasure, trek through the backcountry, or competitively race. Snowshoeing is a fantastic alternative for skiing, especially if you like running!</p>
  <p><b>Ice Climbing - </b> is pretty much what it says on the tin – climbing ice. Ice climbing is very similar to rock climbing and uses strong, robust ropes and crampons that you can accommodate in your travel camera bag, to ascend beautiful icefalls, frozen waterfalls, cliffs and frozen rock faces. In most resorts, you can take guided climbing lessons, which everyone can do providing you’ve got a good level of fitness. All you have to do is get some safety equipment that’s even sturdier and more reliable than the best tennis strings and you’re all set.</p>
  <p><b>Ski Biking - </b> is an awesome sport to try if you’re a skier or snowboarder and fancy trying your hand at something a little different. If you’re a big fan of mountain biking, you are sure to love ski biking too! It’s similar to mountain biking, except on snow, with mini-skis instead of wheels, and you break and slow down by digging your feet into the snow! When on the nursery slopes, ski biking is really easy, it only starts to get more difficult when on steeper routes (make sure you pack some bravery in that rucksack of yours!).</p>
  <p><b>Ice driving - </b>Imagine a race track…made from ice! Many resorts have this incredible experience on offer, where you can jump in a selection of luxury cars, each fitted with studded tyres to traverse the icy surroundings at breakneck speed. This is not the sport for the timid, so pack your big boy boots and try your hand at one of the most fun driving experiences the world has to offer.</p>
  <p><b>Ice Fishing - </b>For a more relaxed activity, you could try your hand at ice fishing. Ice fishing is where you fish with a line and hook through a hole in the ice. This can either be done out in the open or in a heated enclosure, some of which have beds and amenities inside for when fishing for long periods.</p>
