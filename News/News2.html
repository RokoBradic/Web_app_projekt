    <h2>Road trip stories everyone can relate to</h2>
    <h4>A shortcut becomes a longcut.</h4>
    <p>Dad thought it would be a good idea to forgo Highway 70 and forge his own path. The problem is, Dad was wrong about his route shaving an hour-and-a-half off the drive time. Suddenly, 10 hours becomes 14 hours and no one’s happy. </p>
    <p>How to avoid it: Take time to plan your route before you get in the car. It’s much easier to explore different options from the comfort of home than from the driver’s seat.  </p>
    <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">The hotel isn’t quite what you expected.</h4>
    <p>It’s late at night, you’ve found the nearest hotel, and you’re ready to check in. But the hotel clerk says the room rents by the hour, and that bathroom is sketchy at best. You stay because you have to, but a much-needed night of shut-eye is going to be hard to come by.</p>
    <p>How to avoid it: Instead of driving as long as you can and finding a random roadside hotel, cap the hours you’ll put down in a day. That way you can make a hotel reservation ahead of time and spare yourself any unpleasant surprises.</p>
    <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">The directions from the locals turn into a wild goose chase.</h4>
    <p>Take a left at the big oak tree and keep going until you get to a three-way intersection…but were you supposed to take a left or a right to find the highway? Locals in the places you visit are a wealth of information, but since visitors don’t have a good understanding of area landmarks and road names, a favor can fast become a headache.</p>
